## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd AetheraApp
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

> **Note**: Get these values from your Supabase project settings → API

### 4. Database Setup

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Run the migrations in order:
   - `packages/supabase/SQL/schema.sql` - Base schema (profiles, artworks, collections)
   - `packages/supabase/SQL/create_user_profiles.sql` - User profiles table
   - `packages/supabase/SQL/create_certificates.sql` - Certificates table

See `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

### 5. Storage Bucket Setup

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **Storage**
2. Create a bucket named `artwork_images`
3. Set it to **Public** (or configure RLS policies as needed)

### 6. Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm start
```

Or for specific platforms:

```bash
# iOS
pnpm ios

# Android
pnpm android

# Web
pnpm web
```

## 🔑 Key Features Explained

### Artwork Registration Flow

1. **Step 1 - Basic Information**
   - Title, artist name, year, medium, dimensions
   - Image upload (camera or gallery)
   - Status selection (verified/unverified)
   - Creates artwork in database

2. **Step 2 - Certificate & NFC**
   - Optional certificate generation
   - NFC tag linking
   - Certificate automatically associated with NFC tag

3. **Step 3 - Context**
   - Optional location
   - For sale toggle and price

4. **Success Screen**
   - Artwork summary
   - Options to view artwork or link NFC tag

### NFC Tag Reading

The app uses `react-native-nfc-manager` for NFC functionality:

- **iOS**: Requires NFC-enabled device (iPhone 7+)
- **Android**: Requires NFC-enabled device
- **Permissions**: Automatically requested on first use
- **Testing**: Must be done on physical devices (simulators don't support NFC)

### Certificate Generation

- Generates unique certificate IDs (format: `CERT-timestamp-random`)
- Creates QR codes for easy verification
- Generates blockchain hashes (currently simulated, ready for real blockchain integration)
- Links certificates to artworks and NFC tags

## 🧪 Testing

### NFC Testing

1. Build the app on a physical device:
   ```bash
   # For iOS
   pnpm ios

   # For Android
   pnpm android
   ```

2. Navigate to artwork registration → Step 2
3. Enable certificate generation (optional)
4. Tap "Link Tag Now"
5. Grant NFC permissions
6. Hold an NFC tag near the device
7. The app will read and display the tag's UID

### Development Mode

The app currently runs in **development mode** with Supabase operations disabled. To enable database operations:

1. Find code blocks marked with:
   ```typescript
   /* ========== ORIGINAL CODE (DISABLED) ========== */
   ```
2. Uncomment the code
3. Remove or comment out the dev mode sections

## 🏗 Building for Production

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### NFC Not Working

- **Issue**: NFC scanning doesn't work
- **Solutions**:
  - Ensure you're testing on a physical device (not simulator)
  - Check that NFC is enabled in device settings
  - Verify permissions are granted
  - Make sure the device supports NFC (iPhone 7+ for iOS)

### Image Upload Fails

- **Issue**: Images not uploading
- **Solutions**:
  - Check Supabase storage bucket exists and is public
  - Verify storage permissions in Supabase
  - Check network connection
  - Ensure file size is reasonable

### Database Connection Issues

- **Issue**: Can't connect to Supabase
- **Solutions**:
  - Verify `.env` file has correct credentials
  - Check Supabase project is active
  - Verify RLS policies are set correctly
  - Check network connectivity

### Metro Bundler Cache Issues

```bash
# Clear cache and restart
pnpm exec expo start --clear
```
